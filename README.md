# Restaurant-Manager3
I have included all forms in my databases using create, edit, and delete. Once the program starts up, users can create a customer and will be required to fill in their information; their name, their email, and phone number. After filling out their information, a confirmation message is shown in the index page so the user will know that the customer has been successfully added. They can then add a reservation and choose the id of the customer from the drop down menu. I have used a custom attribute that will require users to input the reservation time only if its from the future, that way there will not end with confusion from staff in a real world experience because it would'nt make sense for customers to plan their arrival at a date thats already passed. Users will also be required to enter how many guests will arrive when creating a reservation, adding a limit to 100 guests, that way staff will know exactly how many seats they will need while also not having to prepare for an overwhelming number of customers. Special requests are included as optional, so users will not be required to fill it out if they don't need to. Similar to the customer database, a confirmation will appear to inform the user that a reservation was added successfully. I also included confirmation messages for both delete and edit forms and search features to filter names from both customer and reservations.
